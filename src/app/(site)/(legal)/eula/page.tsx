      </p>

      <h2>1. Acknowledgement</h2>
      <p>
        This EULA is between you and LawBid only, and not with Apple Inc. (“Apple”) or Google LLC (“Google”). LawBid,
        not Apple or Google, is solely responsible for the App and its content. The Apple App Store and Google Play are
        the “App Stores”. Your use of the App must also follow the App Store terms that apply to you.
      </p>

      <h2>2. License grant</h2>
      <p>
        LawBid grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download,
        install and use the App on devices that you own or control, for your own personal or internal business use, as
        allowed by the Usage Rules of the App Store you got it from. The App is licensed, not sold.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Restrictions</h2>
      <p>You may not, and may not allow anyone else to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>copy, modify, translate or create derivative works of the App;</li>
        <li>
          reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or try to get the source code of the App, except where the law allows
          it despite this restriction;
        </li>
        <li>rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise make the App available to a third party;</li>
        <li>remove or change any notice of ownership or any trademark;</li>
        <li>
          bypass or interfere with security, rate limits, license checks or usage limits, or use bots, scrapers or
          automated means to access the App or Service;
        </li>
        <li>use the App to break the law, infringe rights, or in a way that harms other users or the Service;</li>
        <li>
          use the App if you are located in a country subject to a US government embargo or designated as a
          “terrorist-supporting” country, or if you are on a US list of prohibited or restricted parties.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Ownership</h2>
      <p>
        LawBid and its licensors own the App, the LawBid name, logos and all related intellectual property. No rights
        are granted except those stated here. Your content stays yours, under the license in the Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Updates; the App may change</h2>
      <p>
        We may release updates, change features or stop offering the App. Some updates may be needed for the App to keep
        working. The license covers updates unless they come with a separate license.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Support</h2>
      <p>
        LawBid is solely responsible for any maintenance and support for the App. Contact us at {site.supportEmail}.
        Apple and Google have no obligation to provide maintenance or support for the App.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Not legal advice; no law firm</h2>
      <p>
        The App is a marketplace. LawBid is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice. See the Terms and the{" "}
        <Link href="/client-agreement" className="text-gold-300 underline">
          Client Agreement
        </Link>{" "}
        or{" "}
        <Link href="/attorney-agreement" className="text-gold-300 underline">
          Attorney Agreement
        </Link>
        .
      </p>

      <h2>8. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
      <p>
        The App is provided “as is” and “as available”, with all faults. To the fullest extent permitted by law, LawBid
        disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title
        and non-infringement, and does not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, secure or error-free.
        <strong> Apple and Google make no warranty whatsoever about the App.</strong> If the App fails to conform to an
        applicable warranty, you may notify Apple or Google and the App Store may refund the purchase price (if any) of
        the App to you. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple and Google have no other warranty obligation about
        the App.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Product claims</h2>
      <p>
        LawBid, not Apple or Google, is responsible for addressing any claim by you or a third party about the App or
        your possession or use of it, including product liability claims, claims that the App does not meet a legal or
        regulatory requirement, and consumer protection or privacy claims.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Intellectual property claims</h2>
      <p>
        If a third party claims that the App infringes its intellectual property rights, LawBid, not Apple or Google, is
        solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of that claim.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent permitted by law, LawBid is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential or
        punitive damages arising from the App, and its total liability for claims about the App is limited to the
        greater of $100 and the amount you paid LawBid in the 12 months before the claim arose. Neither Apple nor Google
        is liable to you for any claim about the App. Some states do not allow these limits, so they may not apply to
        you.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        This EULA lasts until ended. It ends automatically if you break it. You can end it by deleting the App and
        closing your account. On termination you must stop using the App and delete all copies.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Third-party beneficiaries</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Apple.</strong> You and LawBid acknowledge that Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries
        of this EULA for the iOS version of the App. When you accept this EULA, Apple will have the right (and will be
        deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce it against you as a third-party beneficiary. This right does not
        make Apple a party to this EULA.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Google.</strong> Google is not a party to this EULA and has no obligations under it. Google may enforce
        the Google Play terms against you, but is not a party to this EULA.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Governing law and disputes</h2>
      <p>
        This EULA is governed by the laws of the State of Illinois and applicable federal law. Disputes between you and
        LawBid are resolved under section 20 (binding arbitration, class action waiver and 30-day opt-out) and section
        21 (venue and consumer protections) of the Terms of Service. Nothing here takes away protections of the
        mandatory consumer law of the state where you live.
